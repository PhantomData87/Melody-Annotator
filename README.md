#  Melody-Annotator

## Why this exists
A personal project for organizing effortlessly my notes **dynamically** with a pinch of insperation from Obsidian.
This mainly stems from my own ambition to have an archive of notes to look back to.
However it always seemed that I would spend a grand majority of time sorting the notes, figuring out why I even organized them like so, and countless time devising a new organizational system in my head to only breakdown within a week. This is especially true in my cybersecurity journey.
And I wish that when I copy in Qubes OS. I am actually coping to antoher qube, as I like to keep my notes in a offline qube.

Sorry for my grammar in advanced. No hablo Ingles perfectamente (Ni mi espanol).


## Commonly Asked Questions

#### Why avoid community made imports
Tkinter is widely available everywhere, and its fairly native to python (or so am told)
While any community made imports could probably speed up this process of building this. Where would the fun be in that? And besides some solutions would only bring in more problems.

Such as the reason I re-created Markdown (atleast the basic syntax) because some packages work exclusively by themselves and not with tkinter directly. I would be required to bridge two independant packages together, so why not skip being the middleman and directly change tkinter to suit my needs. Like have Markdown dynamically update as you type?


#### Why use Tkinter
I simply wanted to challenge myself and deepen my understanding on how GUI's are made. Now I know.


#### Why your git ignore filled with testN and other unseen scripts?
As some of them imply, they are scripts where I am testing out different things. Most of them are learning about how tkinter works. Some of the other scripts exist as my notes on how python works. Like regex
When this project is finished to an acceptable level. I will make a folder for the test scripts, comment them, and rename them to be better understood (instead of "test10" which is where I wrote my markdown).
